###### Concept caf√© website built to learn basic Bootstrap

This is one of the first websites I ever built, and the first using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework. It also allowed me to get to grips with more advanced layouts, with a focus on mobile-first responsive design.

## Possible Improvements:
- Finish adding complete pages for 'About Us', 'Contact' etc.
- Improved CSS to remove Bootstrap defaults.
- Responsive image files to improve mobile load time on lower bandwidth connections.
